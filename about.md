**SIRIUS B** stands for **Sharing Inclusive Research Instruction for Underrepresented Students' Benefit**, both figuratively as the driving force behind the organization and literally as, like many names in astronomy, **SIRIUS B** is an acronym. And, like many of those acronyms, it's actually a "backronym", as a nod to Sirius B, the white dwarf companion of the dog star that was discovered with the telescope lens in Northwestern University's Dearborn Observatory. Dearborn has played a crucial role in the pilot of Stellar STEM Weekends, one of our core programs.

More information about the Stellar STEM Weekends and our other programs can be accessed [here](https://siriusb.org/programming).

**SIRIUS B** is a more inclusive rebrand of the [Lakota Cultural Exchange Program](http://thelakotaculturalexchangeprogram.org), evolving naturally with the program as efforts are expanded to reach more students. For more information about the LCEP and how it came to be, please visit that [site](http://thelakotaculturalexchangeprogram.org).
