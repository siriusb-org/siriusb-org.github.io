title: Astronomy as a Field
---

*Astronomy as a Field: A Guide For Aspiring Astrophysicists* was created for students particiating in our [VERGE](https://siriusb.org/programming/#verge-virtual-events-for-remote-gathering-and-engagement) programming. It serves as a general introduction to the field for students and enthusiasts alike, with content that is useful/informative for anyone interested in astronomy. A virtual copy can be accessed on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04041){:target="_blank"} or -- in a more interactive form -- here:
