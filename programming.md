## Stellar STEM Weekends

Stellar STEM Weekends were first piloted in cooperation with the Northwestern University Center for Native American and Indigenous Research (CNAIR), the Northwestern Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion, and the Northwestern Department of Physics and Astronomy in 2018 and 2019. Though the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic derailed the planning that was underway in 2020, we are now back in a position to reprise these Weekends of science education and cultural exchange. We are now exploring the possibility of running a Chicago-area Stellar STEM Weekend later in 2023 with participation from (astro)physicists and affiliates of the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. Check back for more soon!
