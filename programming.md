## Stellar STEM Weekends

Stellar STEM Weekends were first piloted in cooperation with the Northwestern University Center for Native American and Indigenous Research (CNAIR), the Northwestern Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion, and the Northwestern Department of Physics and Astronomy in 2018 and 2019. Though the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic derailed the planning that was underway in 2020, we are now back in a position to reprise these Weekends of science education and cultural exchange. We are now exploring the possibility of resuming running in-person Chicago-area Stellar STEM Weekends. Check back for more soon!

## VERGE: Virtual Events for Remote Gathering and Engagement
<!-- VERGE: Virtual Events for Remotely Generating Engagement -->

A series of virtual workshops for Indigenous students (grades 8 - 11) in remote locations.

VERGE aims to make programming like the Stellar STEM Weekends accessible to Native students from reservations, rural areas, and the like. VERGE weekends will include talks and instruction from professional astronomers/astrophysicists, cultural exchange and a discussion of traditional star knowledge, and a conversation about the night sky as one of our greatest collective resources. 

Though generally useful as a primer, our book, *Astronomy as a Field: A Guide for Aspiring Astrophysicists*, was created as a supplement to the content of VERGE weekends for participating students. A virtual copy can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04041){:target="_blank"}.

VERGE was funded by one of the inaugural grants from the International Astronomical Union's North American Regional Office of Astronomy for Development (NA-ROAD) Women and Girls in Astronomy Program. As a result, our 2024 program exclusively enrolled girls. We anticipate expanding enrollment in the future.

***Our first official VERGE program ran on January 27, 2024 for Native Hawaiian girls in late middle school and high school.***

## Picture an Astronomer

In a one-time series aimed at increasing representation for, and retention of, women in astrophysics, SIRIUS B partnered with the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago to distribute *Astronomy as a Field* to Chicago-area students and the public. We held a kick-off event that focused on the work and accomplishments of UChicago's female astrophysicists, a talk series featuring prominent senior women in the field, and a symposium that connected a number of scientists, including the authors of the SIRIUS B pedagogical text, to discuss retaining talent in astrophysics.

More information is available [here](https://pictureanastronomer.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

This effort was funded by a generous grant from the University of Chicago Women's Board and is supported by the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics and the University of Chicago Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics.
